---

This is a simple application to simulate interacting with a third party API.

###Build Instructions
---

1. You will need to make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed
2. Make sure you're in a directory where you want to add the project by running `pwd` in the terminal and navigating to your desired directory from there.
3. Clone this repo by using the `Code` dropdown or by copying this link https://github.com/seanulus/tp-api.git and running `git clone <url>` in the terminal.
4. After you have succesfully cloned the project you need to install the node_modules. You can do so by running `npm install` in the terminal.
5. Once the node_modules are installed, you can start the server by running the command `npm start` in the terminal. You should see a message stating `App is listening on port 8000`
6. From here you should be able to query this server from postman via http://localhost:8000/ or you can run the test suite with `npm run test`.
